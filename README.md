## Overview

*GEARSHIFT* is ~~(yet to be)~~ a mind-blowingly simple text-based "dungeon crawler" (you aren't in a dungeon) written in C. This project is currently in the "pre-alpha" stage, which means we're just getting started on this thrilling adventure through the ruins of a blue-sky-taken green world.

## System Requirements

*GEARSHIFT* boasts minimalistic system requirements, making it suitable for a wide range of systems, including the legendary potato-powered computers.

- Operating System: Windows or Linux (No, it won't run on your microwave oven).
- Processor: A potato, a toaster, or any CPU with basic arithmetic capabilities.
- Memory: A handful of bytes (RAM not required, but you can sprinkle some if you have it).
- Storage: Almost negligible, *Gearshift* fits on a floppy disk (if you can find one).

## Features

- An awe-inspiring ASCII art realistic representation of the breathtaking Canopy Peaks.

*(Not that realistic.)*
- A star-studded cast of characters and obstacles that never fail to amuse. 

*(Yet to come.)*
- Movement and exploration mechanics that will have you questioning your life choices.

*(Not those much yet.)*
- Approximately one billion hours ~~(give or take)~~ of mind-bendingly engaging gameplay.

*(Not even two minutes right now, but you can always replay it a billion million times.)*

## Todo

### **Long Goals**

- **Map Representation:**
  - [ ] Load the initial map from an external file instead of hardcoding it.

- **Game Logic:**
  - [ ] Define clear objectives or win/lose conditions.
  - [ ] Implement collision detection for advanced gameplay.
  
- **Map Generation:**
  - [ ] **(!!!MAYBE!!!)** Consider implementing a procedural map generation algorithm.
  
- [ ] **Code Organization:**
  - [ ] Group related functions into modules or classes. **(DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT YET)**

- **Error Handling:**
  - [ ] Implement error handling for file I/O. **(DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT YET)**
  
- **Platform Independence:**
  - [ ] Consider using a cross-platform library like ncurses for console input/output. **(DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT YET SOMEONE TOLD ME TO DO THIS)**

- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
  - [ ] Expand the game with additional gameplay mechanics, such as combat, puzzles, or quests.
  
- **Graphics and Animation:**
  - [ ] **(!!!MAYBE!!!)** Improve the visual aspect of the game using graphics libraries like SDL or OpenGL.

### Short Goals

- [ ] Add the gcc command for compiling in the READMEs.

- [ ] Improve the `takeInput` function to handle input errors more robustly.
- [ ] Implement a save and load game feature, who knows.

- [ ] Add a menu, every game needs it.

- [ ] Add a status thingy.

- [ ] Add more characters and obstacles for increased amusement (new tiles and support for them).

- [ ] Increase gameplay duration to at least two minutes

- [ ] Add ability to portal through spaces

- [x] Improve the `takeInput` function to handle input errors more robustly. (I think i solved it)

- [x] ~~Implement microwave oven support.~~ (it works on windows now)

- [ ] Add ability to portal through spaces
