# *GEARSHIFT* - Text Dungeon Crawler

![Game Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Overview

*GEARSHIFT* is a mind-blowingly simple text-based "dungeon crawler" (you aren't in a dungeon) written in C. This project is currently in the "pre-alpha" stage, which means we're just getting started on this thrilling adventure through the ruins of a blue-sky-taken green world.

## Linux Compatibility

**Please Note: *GEARSHIFT* is Designed Exclusively for Linux**

*GEARSHIFT* is specifically designed and (not that) optimized for Linux operating systems. It may not be compatible with other platforms.

## System Requirements

*GEARSHIFT* boasts minimalistic system requirements, making it suitable for a wide range of systems, including the legendary potato-powered computers.

- Operating System: Linux (No, it won't run on your microwave oven).
- Processor: A potato, a toaster, or any CPU with basic arithmetic capabilities.
- Memory: A handful of bytes (RAM not required, but you can sprinkle some if you have it).
- Storage: Almost negligible, *GEARSHIFT* fits on a floppy disk (if you can find one).

## Features

- An awe-inspiring ASCII art realistic representation of the breathtaking Canopy Peaks.

*(Not that realistic.)*
- A star-studded cast of characters and obstacles that never fail to amuse. 

*(Yet to come.)*
- Movement and exploration mechanics that will have you questioning your life choices.

*(Not those much yet.)*
- Approximately one billion hours (give or take) of mind-bendingly engaging gameplay.

*(Not even two minutes right now, but you can always replay it a billion million times.)*
